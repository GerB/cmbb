# cmBB
A simple yet powerful content management system for phpBB

This CMS is an extension for the popular phpBB3 forum system. It therefore requires a phpBB installation to work. phpBB 3.2.x is required.

## Installation

Copy the extension to phpBB/ext/ger/cmbb

Go to "ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" and enable the "cmBB" extension.

If desired, set your Main website URL to < yourforumurl >/app.php/article/index
This enables the homepage listing the last 10 new articles.

## Events
I have included some template events:
* ger_cmbb_main_menu_prepend (before first main menu item)
* ger_cmbb_main_menu_append (after last main menu item)
* ger_cmbb_leftbar_prepend (before left sidebar content) 
* ger_cmbb_leftbar_append (after left sidebar content)
